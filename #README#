# RSG Application

The RSG (Random Sentence Generator) application generates random sentences based on a provided grammar file. It utilizes built-in C++ libraries such as `string`, `ifstream`, `vector`, and `map`, along with custom `Production` and `Definition` classes.

## Overview

The application reads a grammar file, stores the grammar in a map, and generates random sentences from the defined non-terminals.

## Features

- Parses a properly formatted grammar file.
- Utilizes custom `Production` and `Definition` classes.
- Generates random sentences based on the grammar rules.

## How It Works

- **Grammar Parsing**: The `readGrammar` function reads the grammar file and populates a map with non-terminals and their definitions.
- **Sentence Expansion**: The `expand` function recursively generates a sentence starting from a given non-terminal, defaulting to `<start>`.
- **Main Functionality**: The `main` function handles file input, error checking, and outputs the number of definitions and a generated sentence.

## Usage

1. Compile the application:

   ```bash
   g++ -o rsg rsg.cc
